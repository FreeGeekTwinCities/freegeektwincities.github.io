## Conserje

Throughout 2013, we've relied on our Flask-based OpenERP frontend, [portero](https://github.com/FreeGeekTwinCities/portero), to allow our volunteers (and ourselves) to track how many hours are being worked.

Now, in an attempt to make the process even easier, we're rolling out the second iteration of our OpenERP frontend: [conserje](https://github.com/FreeGeekTwinCities/conserje).
